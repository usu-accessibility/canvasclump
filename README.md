## Process

There are two parts to this extension - the frontend UI that the user interfaces with and the extension code that runs in the background and on the webpage. When the extension is run a `background.js` file is loaded. This file listens for the hotkey `CMD-SHIFT-U` and runs the `getLinks()` on that webpage. The data is then saved inside of chrome extension sync storage which is saved across chrome sessions.
